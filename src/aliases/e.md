# Emote

The `!e` alias is used for looking up emotes and then giving back a simple embed describing your character doing that emote.

You can pass in bonuses (`-b`), advantage (`adv`) or disadvantage (`dis`), guidance (`guidance`), bless (`bless`) etc.

## Examples
```
!e dance adv
```
```
!e yoink -t Steve
```
```
!e flex guidance
```
